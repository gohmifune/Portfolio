    <h1>Project Euler Problem 001</h1>
    
    <p>Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:</p>
    
    <p>1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...</p>
    
    <p>By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.</p>
